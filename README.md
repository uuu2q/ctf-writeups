## About this template

Feel free to delete this section after you've read it.

Everything here is written in markdown. If you don't know how to write markdown, [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a good place to start. Github also has some [useful tips](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on how to write markdown.

When picking which year and category to write up, it's suggested you first write up an entire year, then write up the entire category across all years. This is so that you get a feel for which category you like best before writing writeups for all of them in a certain category.

## Attribution

Template and writeup format was heavily inspired by vivian-dai's picoctf 2021 writeup repository [here](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup).
