### Description:
Try reversing this file? Can ya? <br> I forgot the password to this [file](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/273/ret). Please find it for me?

## Solve:
I downloaded the file and opened it with a text editor:

<img width="676" alt="ret" src="https://github.com/uuu2q/ctf-writeups/assets/134032122/b33217b2-43d2-498a-b19d-28e6a39ad074">

The file isn't very long, so I just scanned through it and saw the flag in plaintext: picoCTF{3lf_r3v3r5ing_succe55ful_d7b14d43}.
